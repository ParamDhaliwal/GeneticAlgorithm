GeneticAlgorithm

Programming in C++

A genetic algorithm is an algorithm that draws inspiration from theories of natural selection. That is,
we start with a ‘population’ of sample candidates, evaluate their fitness, perform some sort of cross-over
and mutation, and continue until we have a solution that most closely meets our needs or meets our
termination criteria.

This project helps producing an object oriented implementation of the travelling salesman problem using a genetic algorithm.
